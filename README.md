# python_shooter_game
Authors: Marc McCombe and Navdeep Saini in 2016
This game works on python 2.7 and utilizes pygame and pyqt
This game works by having several "zombie" sprites appear on left side of screen and starting at level 1 will begin advancing to opposite side of screen (towards the town) and your task is to shoot them before they reach the end. Each level you pass increases your score and increases the speed of the zombies for the following level. You are given a set amount of lives and each zombie that reaches the town consumes 1 life. When you run out of lives the game ends.
